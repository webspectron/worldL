// Applied to the public write endpoints (quote submission, shipment booking, document
// auto-generation) — none of these need a session, so nothing else stops a script from
// hammering them to spam the quotes/shipments tables. Much higher ceiling than the login
// limiter (server/routes/auth.ts) since real customers legitimately submitting a quote or
// booking a shipment is the normal case here, not something to be suspicious of — this is
// about stopping bulk/scripted abuse, not slowing down a real customer.
