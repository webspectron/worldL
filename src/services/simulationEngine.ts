/**
 * Despite the name (kept for the broadcast channel/localStorage keys it already shares with
 * every open tab — renaming those would silently break cross-tab sync for anyone with a tab
 * open across a deploy), this class no longer runs any kind of tick loop. Shipments move on
 * their own now, server-side, at their real promised pace (server/progress.ts) — that used to
 * not exist, which is why a client-side setInterval ticker was built here in the first place
 * to fake movement for a demo. Now that real movement is the source of truth for every
 * viewer, on every device, all the time, that ticker was pure redundant surface area: it could
 * only ever show a *temporary, local, unsaved* preview of a shipment moving faster or slower
 * than its real trajectory, which is a confusing thing for an admin console to offer next to
 * data that's already live and correct. What's left is genuinely useful: broadcasting a
 * shipment update to every open tab instantly (scrub, delay, status changes), a one-shot
 * "jump to this percentage" scrub for testing/demos, and delay advisories.
